# Anti-cogging

ODrive supports an anti-cogging algorithm that attempts to compensate for the rather high cogging torques seen in hobby motors.

`<odrv>.<axis>.controller.config.anticogging` is a configuration structure that contains the following items:

Name | Type | Use
-- | -- | --
max_torque | float | Max torque that the anticogging map can apply.
pre_calibrated | bool | If true and using index or absolute encoder, load anticogging map from NVM at startup
calib_anticogging | bool | True when calibration is ongoing
anticogging_enabled | bool | Enable or disable anticogging.  A valid anticogging map can be ignored by setting this to `false`
start_vel | float | Starting velocity for anticogging. Should be high enough for the motor to run and low enough to show visible cogging
end_vel | float | Ending velocity for anticogging. A good value is 1/10 start_vel.
start_gain | float | Multiplier used for anticogging integrator gain. Maximum integrator gain is `vel_integrator_gain * start_gain`
end_gain | float | Multiplier used for anticogging integrator gain. Minimum integrator gain is `vel_integrator_gain * end_gain`
end_tolerance | float | Used in anticogging to determine running speed, gain, and filter bandwidths. This tolerance refers to the mean absolute velocity error.

## Calibration

For the following instructions, `<odrv>` and `<axis>` should be substituted with the actual handles of your ODrive in odrivetool, such as `odrv0.axis0` or `odrv0.axis1`.

To calibrate anticogging, first make sure you can adequately control the motor in velocity control.  It should respond to velocity commands. Anticogging uses your setting for `<odrv>.<axis>.controller.config.vel_integrator_gain`, so you must have stable control before running anticogging. It doesn't have to be perfect, however - the stock gains are fairly loose and they work for anticogging with the ODrive D5065 and D6374 motors.

The anticogging map requires an absolute position reference. An absolute encoder or an incremental encoder with an index pin is required for anticogging. Make sure that your encoder is set to use the index pin before starting calibration - `<odrv>.<axis>.encoder.config.use_index = True`. You must also run the encoder index search before starting. If you have the config option set to use the index, the index search will occur during `AXIS_STATE_FULL_CALIBRATION_SEQUENCE`.

Start by putting the axis in `AXIS_STATE_CLOSED_LOOP` with `CONTROL_MODE_VELOCITY_CONTROL` and `INPUT_MODE_PASSTHROUGH`.  Make sure you have good control of the motor in this state (it responds to velocity commands). It is normal for the motor to experience some cogging torque in this mode before the anticogging calibration has been applied.

Run `<odrv>.<axis>.controller.start_anticogging_calibration()`.  The motor will turn quickly at first and slow down as the cogging map improves. You can monitor `<odrv>.<axis>.controller.input_vel` to see how it is progressing. The end condition is for the motor to have completed 10 turns and for `input_vel` to be within 10% of `end_vel`.

When anticogging is complete, the motor will stop. After anticogging calibration is complete, set `<odrv>.<axis>.requested_state = AXIS_STATE_IDLE` and run `<odrv>.<axis>.controller.anticogging_remove_bias()`. Run `<odrv>.<axis>.requested_state = AXIS_STATE_ENCODER_INDEX_SEARCH` for ODrive to get an absolute position reference and then go into closed loop control.

If the anticogging performance is not good enough for you, you can run calibration again with a lower value of `end_tolerance`.

Here are some plots of how the anticogging performs. Both plots are at 0.05 turns/s, with `input_vel` in blue and `vel_estimate` in orange. Note that at low speeds, `vel_estimate` has quite a bit of noise.

Pre-Anticogging velocity control:

Velocity control with anticogging active:

To run calibration in the negative direction, set both `start_vel` and `end_vel` to negative values.

## Saving to NVM

As of v0.5.1, the anticogging map is saved to NVM after calibrating and calling `odrv0.save_configuration()`

The anticogging map can be reloaded automatically at startup by setting `controller.config.anticogging.pre_calibrated = True` and saving the configuration.  However, this map is only valid and will only be loaded for absolute encoders, or encoders with index pins after the index search.

## Example

``` Py
odrv0.axis0.encoder.config.use_index = True
odrv0.axis0.requested_state = AXIS_STATE_FULL_CALIBRATION_SEQUENCE
odrv0.axis0.encoder.config.pre_calibrated = True
odrv0.axis0.motor.config.pre_calibrated = True

odrv0.axis0.controller.config.control_mode = CONTROL_MODE_VELOCITY_CONTROL
odrv0.axis0.controller.config.input_mode = INPUT_MODE_PASSTHROUGH
odrv0.axis0.requested_state = AXIS_STATE_CLOSED_LOOP_CONTROL

odrv0.axis0.controller.start_anticogging_calibration()

# calibration is over when the motor stops.

odrv0.axis0.requested_state = AXIS_STATE_IDLE
odrv0.axis0.controller.anticogging_remove_bias()

odrv0.save_configuration()
odrv0.reboot()

# your startup sequence may vary
odrv0.axis0.requested_state = AXIS_STATE_ENCODER_INDEX_SEARCH
odrv0.axis0.requested_state = AXIS_STATE_CLOSED_LOOP_CONTROL

# You now have anticogging enabled in closed loop control!
```
